# Maybe we need a better name for "publisher"

This name will probably define the namespaces and the top-level URI:

https://kosa.pariyatti.app/publisher (or equivalent)

This thing, whatever we call it, will be responsible for "front end" data. Managing what is returned through the API will be the responsibility of this piece. It can be thought of as faster-moving than the library. In physical terms, it might represent the front desk of an actual, brick-and-mortar library. In digital terms, it might represent the library's website and social media accounts. Where the "library" (I think that's definitely the right name for it) represents the deeply interlinked documents as nodes in a slow-moving graph, the "publisher" (or whatever) is a much linear timeline: from month to month, it will always have new content and its most important vector is a unified timeline.

I'd prefer to avoid these, but a word with zero connotations might be better

- time: (m.) kāla; samaya; avasara; vāra. (f.) velā. (v.t.) kālaṃ niyameti or miṇāti. (pp.) niyamitakāla
- at that time: (adv.) tadā.
